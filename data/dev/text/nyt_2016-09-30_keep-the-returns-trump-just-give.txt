Keep the Returns, Trump; Just Give Us a Few Figures.

Mr. Trump, I have a deal for you.

I know your tax returns are being audited, and you don't want to give the Internal Revenue Service any more ammunition.

I accept your son's representation that they run to thousands of pages and are too complicated for the average voter.

So just give us this: your adjusted gross income and actual federal taxes paid for the last five years, certified by your accountants. That's a total of 10 numbers, which would fit on a single page.

Those are numbers any taxpayer can understand. They wouldn't tell the I.R.S. anything it doesn't already know.

And while they wouldn't answer many of the questions that have swirled around your finances, they would lay to rest once and for all the most basic question: How much, if anything, do you pay in federal taxes?

The issue has taken on new urgency after this week's presidential debate, when the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton boldly suggested that Donald Trump ''doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes.''

Mr. Trump hardly clarified the matter, treating Mrs. Clinton's remark first as a compliment -- ''That makes me smart'' -- and, when questioned after the debate, asserting, ''Of course, I pay federal taxes.''

It's worth noting that this is the first time in American history that the question has had to be asked of a serious contender for the presidency.

Hopefully, it will also be the last time, if Congress finally requires all presidential candidates to release at least five years of returns, just as federal law requires presidential candidates to disclose their assets and sources of income. That would prevent the kind of time-consuming and needless speculation that Mr. Trump has generated from ever again being an issue in a national election.

''I think Trump and all candidates should do so,'' Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist and tax expert, told me this week. Mr. Holtz-Eakin served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative, pro-growth advocacy group.

A chorus of prominent Republicans has said the same thing, including the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney -- ''It is disqualifying for a modern-day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters'' -- and Fred Goldberg, a former Internal Revenue Service commissioner. ''The sooner he releases his entire returns, the better,'' Mr. Goldberg told CNBC in August.

At this juncture, it's obvious that they are wasting their breath. If Mr. Trump had any intention of releasing his full returns, he would have done so by now. Thus my compromise: a modest amount of disclosure that protects Mr. Trump's interests while giving voters at least some of the information they need to make an informed choice.

So far, Mr. Trump has not taken me up on my offer or, as might be expected from such a veteran negotiator, made a counteroffer. Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, did not respond to my messages.

By now it should be obvious that voters want to know what's in Mr. Trump's returns. A Quinnipiac University poll released in late August found that 74 percent of likely voters said Mr. Trump should release his tax returns. Sixty-two percent of Republicans agreed.

Contrary to his claim that people would ''learn nothing,'' there would be a wealth of relevant information of vital interest to many voters.

For starters, and assuming that any tax avoidance on his part is legal, we would know exactly what loopholes in the tax code enable someone as wealthy as Mr. Trump claims to be to pay little or no federal tax.

Mr. Trump has attacked loopholes that benefit others, and has called for eliminating the tax treatment of so-called carried interest, which benefits many hedge fund and private equity managers. But has he called for changing any of the provisions that benefit him?

If, as I've suggested, he and other real estate developers benefit from their ability to deduct paper losses against ordinary income and to defer capital gains taxes indefinitely through so-called like-kind exchanges, he has proposed nothing that would probably increase his own taxes.

At the very least, he has yet to explain why these loopholes for real estate developers should be retained and how they benefit the public.

It's also impossible to evaluate Mr. Trump's broader tax proposals without knowing how they would affect him. Mr. Trump has called for taxing so-called ''pass through'' income, such as that generated by limited liability companies and partnerships, at a new low 15 percent rate -- far lower than the top 33 percent rate he has proposed for individuals. We know from his financial disclosure statements that most of Mr. Trump's assets are held in the form of L.L.C.s and partnerships. So is this just another self-dealing benefit for Mr. Trump, or is it motivated by the public interest?

There's no way to tell without seeing his tax returns.

Mr. Trump's returns would also shed light on how aggressive his accounting has been and how close to the line of legality he has been willing to walk. As Steven M. Rosenthal, a tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, recently put it, ''Did Trump lower his taxes through legal tax avoidance, or illegal tax evasion?''

Mr. Trump has never been charged with any wrongdoing, but there's a large gap between illegal behavior that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and what most people would consider appropriate conduct by a candidate for president. What Mr. Trump considers ''smart'' might be seen by others as evasive. ''Candidate Trump should follow the precedent set by every major party presidential candidate -- and president -- since Nixon and release his tax returns,'' Mr. Rosenthal said.

That Mr. Trump is being audited only strengthens the case for disclosure. Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited the audit as the reason he's not releasing his returns, as he did again during the debate. As many tax experts, including Mr. Goldberg, have pointed out, Mr. Trump is free to disclose his returns even if they are being audited.

If the I.R.S. has questions about Mr. Trump's tax compliance in his most recent returns, voters should know what those questions are now -- not after the election. (Imagine the spectacle if the I.R.S. sues a sitting president for back taxes.)

Indeed, it would have been far better if Mr. Trump had released the returns during the primaries, when Republican voters could have considered them.

Moreover, none of his arguments should prevent him from releasing earlier returns that are no longer being audited. The Trump campaign has said he's not being audited for returns at least before 2009. Those and even older returns would shed light on how Mr. Trump conducts his business and whether he has paid substantial federal tax.

His returns would also help assess broader questions about Mr. Trump's integrity. By running a campaign that rests in large part on his claims of being a successful businessman, and, to a lesser degree, a generous donor to charitable causes, Mr. Trump has put these matters in play.

There are also less tangible but no less important reasons to release the returns. Can someone who pays little or no tax, if that proves to be the case, relate to the average taxpaying American worker?

Speaking to students at Drexel University in Philadelphia this week, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. responded to Mr. Trump's debate interjection that not paying taxes made him ''smart.''

''Tell that to the janitor in here who's paying taxes,'' Mr. Biden said. ''Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes.''
