Clinton Plan for Taxes Is Expansive but Complex.

It's hard to imagine a tax code more complicated than the one we already have.

Hillary Clinton has come up with one.

''This isn't tax reform,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative, pro-growth advocacy group. ''It's anti-reform. She's layering on even more complexity.''

His views were echoed by a number of tax experts I spoke to this week about Mrs. Clinton's tax plans, as I did earlier about Donald J. Trump's.

In Mrs. Clinton's favor, all the experts I interviewed said her proposals were more detailed, transparent and consistent than Mr. Trump's and, even more important, would not blow open an estimated $10 trillion hole in the federal budget over a decade, as Mr. Trump's proposals would.

''It has the important virtue of being fiscally responsible,'' Leonard E. Burman, director of the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said of Mrs. Clinton's plan. ''It doesn't make our long-term fiscal problems worse.''

To varying degrees, all agreed that Mrs. Clinton's proposal would increase taxes on the rich and big business but that it would add so many new layers of complexity that it would, above all, be a huge boon for tax lawyers. ''There's a lot of new complexity,'' said Mr. Burman.

Although Mrs. Clinton's plan is intended to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more than they now do, it leaves intact loopholes that allow wealthy real estate developers like Mr. Trump to pay little or no tax, which could serve as a vehicle for sophisticated tax lawyers to exploit.

David Kamin, an outside adviser to the campaign on tax and budget issues and an associate professor at New York University School of Law, said that the campaign was ''taking a close look'' at provisions benefiting people like Mr. Trump, and that her proposals did not purport to cover every loophole she might seek to close or change as president.

As for complexity, ''broadening the base and closing loopholes for the wealthy inevitably involve a certain amount of administration,'' said Mr. Kamin, who emphasized that her proposals would simplify returns for small businesses and people with modest tax burdens.

The experts generally praised Mrs. Clinton's proposals to benefit small businesses, which include a provision that would allow them to immediately deduct up to $1 million in capital investments, which would ordinarily have to be depreciated. (Mr. Trump has also called for immediately deducting capital investments, but on an even wider scale.)

Mrs. Clinton has been frank in her acknowledgment that to pay for the many new social programs she has proposed, she needs to raise revenue, which she plans to do primarily through a tax increase on the rich.

The Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution estimates that Mrs. Clinton's tax plan would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade; the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the more conservative Tax Foundation puts the figure at $498 billion, assuming no reduction in economic output from the tax increase.

Nearly all the increase would come from new taxes on the wealthiest Americans. For those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $5 million, she would impose a 4 percent surcharge on top of the normal tax system. For those with incomes above $1 million, she would install a 30 percent effective tax rate, a version of what has become known as the ''Buffett rule'' after Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, complained that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. Mrs. Clinton's plan would also cap the tax value of deductions and exemptions at 28 percent and raise the estate tax.

She would also close the notorious ''carried interest'' loophole that primarily benefits hedge fund operators and private equity managers, and, unlike Mr. Trump, not give it back by means of tax cut on the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of it.

The Tax Policy Center estimates that the top 1 percent of taxpayers -- those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000 -- would face an average tax increase of $78,000, while the lower 95 percent -- those earning less than $300,000 -- would face little or no increase.

But over all, Mrs. Clinton has shied away from a sweeping tax overhaul. ''It's more tinkering at the edges,'' said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation's policy center. ''I wouldn't call it reform. There aren't any major reformulations to make the code simpler or fairer. It's basically just a tax increase'' for the top income bracket.

It goes without saying that raising taxes on the rich while leaving most of the existing tax code intact is anathema to Republicans and conservative economists, as well as many centrist Democrats who have long held dreams of a bipartisan ''Grand Bargain'' to carry out a sweeping tax overhaul to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the American economy.

''I have admiration for the mechanics'' of the Clinton proposals, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''They're more detailed and structured than Trump's. But I have serious concerns about the quality. Their philosophy seems to be to give up on economic growth and try to deliver middle-class prosperity by taking from the rich.''

Everyone I interviewed criticized as fiendishly complicated and ineffectual what is probably Mrs. Clinton's most innovative proposal, which is to put in place a graduated scale for tax rates on capital gains.

Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, taxpayers reporting capital gains held for one to two years would pay their ordinary income tax rate, which currently goes as high as 39.6 percent, just as they do now for gains held less than a year. Gains of two to three years would be subject to a 36 percent rate, and after that the rate would decline by four percentage points each year until it reached the current long-term rate of 20 percent. (All rates exclude the additional 3.8 percent surtax on net investment income.) In effect, there would be seven rate brackets for capital gains, compared with two under the current code.

Although this nominally raises capital gains rates for some assets, it is not clear what, if any, effect it might have on overall revenue. The Tax Foundation estimates that it would cost the Treasury $374 billion over 10 years because it would encourage investors to hold assets longer, which would defer their taxes. The Tax Policy Center says it would depress revenue in the early years as investors delayed sales, but would eventually add $84 billion over 10 years.

But the goal is not revenue; it's supposed to curb ''activist'' investors and others focused on short-term results, and persuade corporate executives to manage for the long term rather than for quarterly profit, according to a speech Mrs. Clinton delivered at New York University in July 2015.

However laudable the goal, using the capital gains tax ''is a misguided approach,'' said Mr. Burman (a view echoed by everyone I interviewed).

''There's no empirical evidence whatsoever this would have any effect on management decision-making,'' Mr. Burman said. ''The real issue is corporate governance. It would be better if management faced more, not less, pressure from investors.''

How did such an arcane proposal, likely to appeal to a tiny sliver of voters, even make it into Mrs. Clinton's tax plan?

The plan is lifted almost whole cloth from a paper published shortly before Mrs. Clinton's N.Y.U. speech titled ''How to Foster Long-Term Innovation Investment'' by Neera Tanden and Blair Effron.

Ms. Tanden, a close confidante and former campaign worker for Mrs. Clinton, succeeded the Clinton campaign manager John Podesta as president of the Center for American Progress, the think tank that published the paper. Mr. Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a Wall Street private equity and investment banking firm. Mr. Effron is also a major donor and fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign and has been mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a Clinton administration.

''Secretary Clinton believes that American businesses need to break free from the tyranny of today's earnings report so they can focus on innovating and investing for the long term,'' said Mike Schmidt, an economic policy adviser at the Clinton campaign. ''That's what this proposal is designed to advance.''

Mrs. Clinton's proposals also do nothing to address the corporate tax rate, which, at 35 percent, is the highest in the developed world (though few companies actually pay anywhere near that rate). President Obama called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent in a compromise rebuffed by Republicans, but Mrs. Clinton would leave it at 35 percent and try to extract even more revenue by closing various loopholes.

''You'd think the business community would be up in arms over this, but I haven't heard a peep,'' said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. ''The focus on personalities has driven this off the radar.''

Several experts cautioned, as did the Clinton campaign itself, that Mrs. Clinton's tax proposals might well evolve after the election should she become president.

Details aside, Mrs. Clinton's tax proposals offer a stark alternative to Mr. Trump's and send a clear message that a top priority ''is increasing the tax liability at the top,'' Mr. Kamin said.

''The message is, that has to be a key element of any progressive tax reform. Beyond that, she has other priorities as well, such as simplifying taxes for small businesses and tax relief for working families,'' he added. ''But these are the key priorities, not a comprehensive list of every detail in the tax code that needs reform.''
