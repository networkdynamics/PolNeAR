Obama Says African-American Museum Will Tell of 'Suffering and Delight.'

WASHINGTON -- President Obama, dedicating the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Saturday, said it would tell an American story, one of ''suffering and delight, one of fear, but also of hope, of wandering in the wilderness, and then seeing, out on the horizon, a glimmer of the Promised Land.''

Speaking to dignitaries and thousands of people watching from the National Mall, Mr. Obama said the museum would document the stories of Americans who are often overlooked in history books -- ''the president but also the slave, the industrialist but also the porter, the keeper of the status quo, but also the activist seeking to overthrow that status quo.''

On a day rich in symbolism, under a gray sky that seemed to capture the ambiguity of the black American experience, Mr. Obama warned that the museum would not be a panacea for the nation's racial struggles, which, even today, inflame the streets of cities like Charlotte, N.C.

''A museum alone will not alleviate poverty in every inner city,'' he said. ''It won't eliminate gun violence from all our neighborhoods, or immediately ensure that justice is always colorblind.''

But Mr. Obama said the museum's exhibits would put those problems into a larger context, allowing people to see the progress as well as the shortcomings in American society. He said he hoped it would encourage a dialogue among Americans on difficult issues like the systemic racism in law enforcement or the violence toward police officers.

''Hopefully,'' the president said, ''this museum can help us talk to each other, and more importantly listen to each other, and most importantly see each other.''

''Perhaps they can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of a demonstrator in Ferguson and Charlotte,'' Mr. Obama said. And perhaps, he said, it could help a black visitor see the efforts of police officers who, ''in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing.''

Acts of protest, Mr. Obama said, are acts of patriotism, whether it was sitting at a lunch counter in the South in the 1960s or wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ''I can't breathe,'' as Eric Garner, gasping facedown on a sidewalk in Staten Island, said before he died.

Mr. Obama has articulated these themes before, most notably in his speech on the 50th anniversary of the protest march in Selma, Ala. But on Saturday, his tone was less anguished or exhortatory than it has been in the past. He was clearly rejoicing in the glorious history contained in this newest outpost of the Smithsonian Institution.

''We've shown the world we can float like butterflies and sting like bees,'' Mr. Obama said, not even needing to mention the author of that boast, Muhammad Ali, who died three months ago. African-Americans, he said, can ''rock like Jimi'' and ''stir the pot like Richard Pryor.''

''We're not a burden on America or a stain on America, or an object of pity or charity for America,'' the president added. ''We're America.''

Mr. Obama officially opened the museum by ringing a large bell from an 18th-century black church in Virginia, in an echo of bells rung to mark the emancipation of the slaves. He spoke against the majestic bronze backdrop of the museum, a kind of inverted ziggurat not far from the Washington Monument. In its shadow, viewers were spread across the lawn and pressed against a fence, listening intently to the president.

His speech was the centerpiece of a solemn, yet quietly jubilant, ceremony featuring the civil rights leader John Lewis, a Democratic congressman from Georgia, as well as celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Patti LaBelle and Stevie Wonder, who joked of the museum, ''I haven't seen it yet, but I'm going to.''

Ms. LaBelle got a huge roar from the crowd when, at the end of her emotional rendition of the civil rights anthem ''A Change Is Gonna Come,'' she added the words, ''Hillary Clinton.''

There was a panoply of dignitaries, including George W. Bush, who signed the legislation authorizing the building of the museum, and his wife, Laura, who spoke of her early brainstorming discussions with the museum's director, Lonnie Bunch. Bill Clinton watched from the front row, sitting alongside Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson sat nearby.

''This museum tells the truth that a country founded on the principles of liberty held thousands in chains,'' Mr. Bush declared. ''Even today, the journey towards justice is not compete. But this museum will inspire us to go farther and get there faster.''

The museum, Mr. Bush said, celebrated several of his heroes, including the musician Chuck Berry, the baseball player Willie Mays and the Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. spoke of the legacy of racism, enshrined in Jim Crow laws, and how the fight for justice flowed through -- and was sometimes set back by -- landmark court rulings, from the Dred Scott case to Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. Board of Education. To understand the real Dred Scott, Chief Justice Roberts said, one should visit this museum.

Donna Sampson Rawlings, 59, of Ashton, Md., who watched the ceremony on a screen on the Mall, said the event brought back memories of her father, and of ''all the people who weren't here who did things to get us here.''

She said she had toured the museum last week during a special program. Many of the visitors were older, she said, and ''I had to step back and think, 'This is their lives.'.''

''If you're 80 years old, you went through so much of this,'' she added. ''Seeing it is, for them, emotional. It's something they never thought they'd see.''

''These are the stories that we talk about that nobody knows,'' she said.

Johnnie Wilson, of Springfield, Va., said he had fought in Vietnam ''for the nation's rights, knowing that back home we didn't have the rights.''

He said the museum compensated for what he believed was a sanitized version of history taught in schools. ''Throughout the time we've been on these shores, we've made major contributions to America,'' he said. ''We're really part of an American history that isn't told like it should be in classrooms.''

Mr. Obama, who was given a sneak peek of the museum recently with his family, spoke during his speech of a stone slaver's block on exhibit, marked only as the site of a speech by Andrew Jackson in 1830.

It was, the president said, ''a stone where day after day for years, men and women were torn from their spouse or their child, shackled and bound, and bought and sold, and bid like cattle, on a stone worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet.''

The museum, Mr. Obama said, would make visitors face uncomfortable truths. But it would also capture the essential greatness of the United States -- the perpetual struggle to live up to its highest ideals.

Mr. Obama spoke emotionally of his many flights on Marine One across the Mall, past the alabaster spire of the Washington Monument and the lighted figure of Abraham Lincoln, sheltered in his memorial. He said he had watched the museum rise from the ground and thought of the days when he and his family would return to visit it as private citizens.

''We'll walk away that much more in love with this country,'' he said, ''the only place on earth where this story could have unfolded.''
