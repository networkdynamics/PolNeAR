WikiLeaks: Hillary Clinton Flattered Obama For His ‘Body Language.’

After President Barack Obama lost both the Senate and the House to Republicans in 2014 midterm elections, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sent a flattering email to him praising his “body language” during a post-election press conference.

“I thought your press conference presentation–words, tone, body language, teasing w reporters and occasional flashes of your smile– was right on target,” Clinton gushed.

During the press conference, Obama admitted that Republicans won fairly.

“Obviously, Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns,” he said during his press conference.

Clinton compared the president to a duck, “smoothly sailing on the surface while paddling like crazy below.”

“I’m always available to you to discuss any and all matters if I can be helpful to you,” she wrote soothingly.

Clinton sent a copy of her email to Obama (who she dubbed “Mr. P”) to John Podesta, which was published by WikiLeaks after his private email account was hacked.

She also pitched the president about mentioning ivory trafficking and elephant poaching during his trip to China, a favorite issue for her and her daughter Chelsea Clinton.

“I am so ready to work on this. Let’s make it one of our joint projects!” she emailed her daughter Chelsea Clinton in 2012 after she expressed concern about the issue.
