Republican Presidential Candidates Give Calculated Super Bowl Predictions.

During Saturday night’s candidate debate, on the eve of the Super Bowl, ABC moderator David Muir asked Republicans a simple question: Who do you think will win the Super Bowl, the North Carolina Panthers or the Denver Broncos?

“Carolina’s going to win that one,” Gov. Kasich replied. “I hate to say it. But they’re going to win that one.”

Jeb Bush pointed out that since Peyton Manning was supporting him in his presidential campaign, he would support the Denver Broncos.

Marco Rubio flipped his choice on the spot – saying he was rooting for Peyton Manning but would now root for North Carolina since Jeb chose Denver.

Donald Trump went with the odds, pointing out that North Carolina would win – even though he picked Peyton Manning to win in an interview on last Sunday’s interview on CBS Face the Nation.

Cruz openly admitted that his pick was politically motivated, looking to the February 20 primary in South Carolina. “With an eye to February 20th, Carolina,” he said.

Carson defied the question, and didn’t make a choice. “With 100 percent certainly, I will predict the winner – it will either be Denver or Carolina,” he said.

Governor Chris Christie – a Dallas Cowboys fan – gave a one word answer on the question. “Denver,” he answered.
