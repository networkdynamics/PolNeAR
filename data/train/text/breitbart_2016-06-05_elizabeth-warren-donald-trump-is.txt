Elizabeth Warren: Donald Trump Is a ‘Proven Failure’ in Business.

Saturday at the Massachusetts Democratic state’s party convention Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump was a “proven failure” in business.

Warren said Trump university was “like a used car dealership—except that’s unfair to used car dealerships.”

“Trump’s salespeople would focus on how much money people could come up with,” she continued. “And then they would push perceptive students to max out their credit cards so they could fork over thousands some times ten of thousand to Donald. His playbook said to look for people with problems. Why? Because they make good targets.”

Listing several of Trumps business ventures she added, Donald Trump is a proven businessman, a proven failure.”
