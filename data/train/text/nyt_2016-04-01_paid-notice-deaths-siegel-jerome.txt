Altogether, Jerome and Ruth had 17 adoring grandchildren.

Jerome also founded Henry Realty, a firm focused on real estate and other ventures and investments. Jerome had too many achievements to mention all, but he was especially proud of his active Board role at Big Brothers/Big Sisters of NYC for over 20 years where he recently funded the Urban Assembly School for Global Commerce in Harlem, as well as his Board service and philanthropy involving The Ruth Leff Siegel Awards for Excellence in Pancreatic Cancer Research, Westchester Community College, Sarah Lawrence College, and The Weizmann Institute of Science.
