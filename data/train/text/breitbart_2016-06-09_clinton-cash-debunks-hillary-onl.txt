Clinton Cash Debunks Hillary: Only ‘One or Two Instances’ where Donations ‘Slipped through the Cracks.’

Presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton said The Clinton Foundation had “overwhelming disclosure,” referencing its donations on Wednesday, but multiple reports reveal that’s untrue.

She was defending the organization against recent attacks from presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, but admitted “one or two instances” where the nonprofit’s donations may have “slipped through the cracks.”

Multiple news reports and a detailed account from Breitbart News’ editor Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash, reveal there was more than “one or two instances.”

Breitbart News’ Michael Patrick Leahy previously reported, The Clinton Foundation refused to release the names of 1,076 foreign donors.

Bloomberg also reported that roughly 1,100 foreign donor names weren’t disclosed.

Schweizer’s Clinton Cash details several incidents of foreign donations to The Clinton Foundation. Both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal confirmed a few of his revelations, which are detailed in the book.

For example, Schweizer notes the foundation hid four donations that totaled $2.35 million from a Russian uranium company headed by Ian Telfer, which was a violation of the Memorandum of Understanding with the Obama administration.

The New York Times confirmed that observation, reporting:

"As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well."
