Trump leads pack; terrorism a top issue; 
Ahead by double digits over Carson.

Attacks in Paris this month have brought the issue of terrorism back to the forefront of the presidential campaign -- a development that's done nothing to diminish Donald Trump's standing in state and national polls.

A national poll released Sunday by The Washington Post and ABC News shows the New York billionaire maintaining his lead among Republicans after the attacks. His 32% support gives him a double-digit advantage over his closest rival in the crowded GOP field, Ben Carson.

While those surveyed said former Florida governor Jeb Bush has the "best experience," Trump is the candidate Republican voters trust most to deal with terrorism, with 42% preferring the current front-runner. Bush was second with 18%.

And in New Hampshire, whose Feb. 9 primary election is the first in the nation, terrorism has surpassed the economy as the top issue. Again, those surveyed said Trump was best able to handle the issue.

Trump's response to the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks has been controversial. He has proposed conducting surveillance on mosques and signaled support for a database of Muslims who could be terrorists.

"Everyone else is coming out with polls saying I'm leading because people are sick and tired of stupid and incompetent people leading our nation," Trump said on ABC's This Week. "We have incompetent people."

Trump also embraced enhanced interrogation techniques -- "I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they'd do to us."

Trump leads the field in the Granite State with just 22%, according to a Suffolk University/Boston Globe Poll released Sunday.

But with other voters split among a half-dozen competitors, "Donald Trump's loyal 22% goes a long way in New Hampshire," says David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston.
