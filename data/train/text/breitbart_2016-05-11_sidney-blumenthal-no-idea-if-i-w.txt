Sidney Blumenthal: ‘No Idea’ If I Would Have Told Hillary Private Email Server Was a Bad Idea.

Former Clinton Senior Adviser Sidney Blumenthal said that he has “no idea” if he would have told Hillary Clinton not to use a personal server if he knew she had one at the time on Wednesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “New Day.”

Blumenthal was asked, “If you had known she had a personal server, would you have told her it’s not a good idea?” He answered, “I have no idea. We’re old friends, and when you’re friend of somebody who’s in the middle of politics, you get caught up in politics, too.”
