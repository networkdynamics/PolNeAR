Trump tells 3,000 in Reno NFL has gone ‘soft’ like the US.

RENO, Nev. (AP) — Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump says he doesn’t watch professional football much anymore because the NFL has gone “soft” like the United States.

Trump drew the analogy during a campaign speech to more than 3,000 people in downtown Reno on Sunday while casino sportsbooks were jammed with fans across the street watching the NFL playoffs.

The billionaire real estate magnate says a violent hit that used to be considered a great tackle by the likes of Hall of Famer Dick Butkus now draws a 15-yard penalty for head-to-head contact.

Trump says “the whole game has become screwed up” because “football has become soft like the country has become soft.” He says referees are constantly throwing penalty flags just so their wives can see them on TV.
