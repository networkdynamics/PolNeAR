Oil Prices Keep Market Gains in Check.

Stocks on Wall Street ended slightly higher on Friday, helped by better-than-expected quarterly results from Google's parent company, Alphabet, and the retailer Amazon and a modest recovery in oil prices.

However, the gains were held back by disappointing results from Exxon Mobil as well as news from the Bank of Japan, which did not announce as much stimulus as many had hoped.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 24.11 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,432.24. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,173.60 and the Nasdaq composite increased 7.15 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,162.13.

The Dow was held back partly by a drop in the oil giant Exxon Mobil. The company reported its smallest quarterly profit in 17 years, well below what analysts were looking for, because of the continuing weakness in oil prices. Its major competitor, Chevron, fared slightly better. While earnings dropped sharply from a year ago, Chevron's results still beat analysts' expectations.

Exxon fell $1.25, or 1.4 percent, to $88.95. Chevron climbed 69 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $102.48 after being down earlier in the day.

Wall Street is finishing its busiest week of corporate earnings, which was dominated by mostly strong results from technology companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and others.

Alphabet, the parent company of Google, jumped $25.50, or 3.3 percent, to $791.34. The company reported earnings of $8.42 a share, well above the $8.04 that analysts were looking for.

Amazon rose $6.20, or 1 percent, to $758.81. The online retail giant reported a profit of $1.78 per share, well above the $1.11 a share that analysts expected. Amazon reported it sold $30.4 billion in goods in the quarter, up 31 percent from a year earlier.

The strong results from Amazon and Google, as well as the results from other tech companies, helped lift the technology-heavy Nasdaq 1.2 percent this week, while the Dow lost 0.8 percent. The S.&P. 500 closed the week down slightly. It was the first weekly loss for the S.&P. 500 after four weeks of gains.

The presidential election will continue to grow as an issue for markets in the next several months. Investors tend to dislike uncertainty, and the unexpectedly close presidential election and mostly unknown policies of the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, puts many of them on edge.

Japan's central bank ended a policy meeting on Friday by announcing it would expand purchases of exchange-traded funds from financial institutions to help inject more cash into the world's third-largest economy and pursue its inflation target of 2 percent. But the measures fell short of hopes for more aggressive action. That helped the yen surge as investors priced in fewer yen in circulation. The dollar dropped to 102.02 yen from 105.34 yen.

Bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark United States 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.45 percent from 1.51 percent the day before.

In energy trading, benchmark crude reversed earlier losses and was up 46 cents to settle at $41.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 24 cents, to $42.46 a barrel in London.

Heating oil rose less than 1 cent, to $1.28 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline futures rose 1 cent, to $1.32 a gallon, and natural gas was little changed at $2.86 per thousand cubic feet.

In other currencies, the euro rose to $1.1175 from $1.1074 the day before, and the British pound rose to $1.3231 from $1.3158.

The price of gold closed up $16.70, to settle at $1,349 an ounce. Silver rose 15 cents, to $20.07 an ounce and copper rose a penny, to $2.222 a pound.
