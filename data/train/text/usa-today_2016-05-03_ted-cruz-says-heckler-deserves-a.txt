Ted Cruz says heckler deserves a spanking for his outburst.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has made no secret of the fact that he spanks his daughter when she misbehaves. He has also suggested the American people should deliver a "spanking" to Hillary Clinton.

Now, he is prescribing the same discipline for a protester who interrupted him during a rally in Indiana on Sunday.

"Apparently there's a young man who's having some problems," Cruz said as the heckler yelled: "You suck!"

"Thank you, son," Cruz replied, before adding that he thinks "children should actually speak with respect."

"Imagine what a different world it would be if someone had told Donald Trump that years ago," he said. "You know, in my household, when a child behaves that way, they get a spanking."

The exchange comes as Cruz and Trump are stumping for every last vote heading into to the Republican primary in Indiana on Tuesday. Trump leads Cruz by roughly 9 percentage points, 42%-32.7%, in the RealClearPolitics average of recent Hoosier polls. A win there could help solidify Trump's claim to the nomination, while dealing Cruz a formidable blow.
