Anti-Trump Groups Launch Ads in Indiana Against The Donald.

GOP frontrunner Donald Trump is facing attack ads ahead of the May 3 primary in Indiana.

The ads come from Our Principles PAC, a Super PAC aimed at taking out the frontrunner, and from the Club for Growth group.

Our Principles PAC, which was founded by former Mitt Romney staffer Katie Packer and is dedicated to stopping Trump, launched a television and radio ad in Indiana on Saturday afternoon titled, “Scam.”

It slams Trump University for receiving a ‘D-‘ rating from the Better Business Bureau while charging students more than $30,000.

The Super PAC also plans to target Indiana voters via mail, phone calls and digital ads.

In Wisconsin, Our Principles PAC spent $1.3 million dollars ahead of the primary, helping Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) win big in the Badger state.

The Club for Growth is reportedly spending $1.5 million on television advertisements ahead of the Indiana primary.

One Club for Growth ad, which is currently airing, argues that “only Ted Cruz can beat Donald Trump. John Kasich can’t do it. The math won’t work. A vote for Kasich actually helps Trump by dividing the opposition.”

Donald Trump has a slight lead in the polls over Cruz in Indiana.
